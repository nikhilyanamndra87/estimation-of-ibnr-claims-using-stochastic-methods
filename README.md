# estimation-of-ibnr-claims-using-stochastic-methods
estimation of ibnr claims is implemented using stochastic reserving methids as the real time data is changing and are having random patterns and in this project all kinds of stochastic reserving methods implementation in python and finally comparison of traditional reserving methods and stochastic reserving methods are implemented and it is proven that estimation on both kinds of methods are same but there is a thing that is missing in the traditional reserving methods is the uncertainty risk prediction and that is implemented using stochastic reserving methods which will help in projecting and planning the future reserves.
